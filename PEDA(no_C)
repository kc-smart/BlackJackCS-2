Problem: Allow a user to play blackjack against the computer.

Examples:
	Dealer hit 21;
	player hit 21
	Dealer bust; 
	player bust
	Dealer/player take additional cards (hit) as needed until BlackJack or bust

Data and Algorithm:
//create deck
createDeck();
Card(face, suit);


//shuffle deck
shuffleDeck();

//assign value to cards
cardValues(face);

//deal cards to dealer and player one
dealGame();
dealerHand list;
playerOneHand list;


//calculate each players handTotal
handTotal(value, dealerHand, playerOneHand);

//offer player one additional cards until hit or bust
	playerOneHand.add(random);

//dealer take cards based on handTotals
	if(hand<21 && playerOneHand>hand){
		dealerHand.add(random);
	}


//determine winner based on handTotal
winner();
	if(hand>21){
		dealerWins!}
	else if(dealer>playerOneHand){
		dealerWins!;}
	else if(dealer==playerOneHand){
		dealerWins!;}
	else{
		playerOneWins!;}

//play again?
playAgain();
